**3\. demand\_scoreboard.csv** (0–100 score assessing demand viability using weighted criteria):

Assuming weighting: 30% Problem Pain Intensity, 25% Existing Solution Gap, 20% Willingness to Pay, 15% Feasibility/Tech Maturity, 10% Competitive Moat. (Scores are normalized to 100.)

Criteria,Weight,Score (0-100),Weighted Score  
Severe Pain Point (founders need guided planning),30%,90,【90\*0.30=】27.0  
Solution Gap (current tools piecemeal or too generic),25%,85,【85\*0.25=】21.3  
Willingness to Pay (budgets of $150-$1000 seen),20%,80,【80\*0.20=】16.0  
Feasibility & Tech Readiness (LLMs \+ agents now capable),15%,75,【75\*0.15=】11.3  
Competitive Moat (mixing strategy+DDD is novel),10%,70,【70\*0.10=】7.0  
Total,100%,–,82.6

*(The demand score of \~83/100 indicates strong validated demand, with especially high pain point and gap scores, tempered slightly by execution feasibility and competition factors.)*
